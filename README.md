the very first time the phrase : "when life gives you lemons.." was used,
 was in a a poetic rendition of the phrase entitled The Optimist appeared in a 1940 edition of The Rotarian: 

   * "Life handed him a lemon,
    As Life sometimes will do.
    His friends looked on in pity,
    Assuming he was through.
    They came upon him later,
    Reclining in the shade
    In calm contentment, drinking
    A glass of lemonade."*
