the very first time the phrase : "when life gives you lemons.." was used, was in a poetic rendition of the phrase entitled The Optimist appeared in a 1940 edition of The Rotarian:

"Life handed him a lemon, As Life sometimes will do. His friends looked on in pity, Assuming he was through. They came upon him later, Reclining in the shade In calm contentment, drinking A glass of lemonade."*
thank you..

In life you have 3 C's, Choice, Chance and Change...
You make a Choice and take your Chance that will eventually Change your life...

Thank guys. All very interessting. Needs more dragons and shit though.
